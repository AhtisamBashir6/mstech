We face a global IT talent shortage. There are more than 11 million job openings in America today, with a greater demand for cloud computing, big data, and information security. Additionally, employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shrinking IT talent pool and an ever-increasing demand make the IT landscape highly competitive. It also makes it more challenging to find qualified talent critical for business growth. But that doesn’t mean we stop looking for talent. We have to innovate and find partners that can help find the right talent for our business’s continued growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a report from Pew Research Center, the most prominent reasons Americans quit their jobs last year were low pay, lack of career advancement, and disrespect. The report also found people who left for a new job received better compensation, more advancement opportunities, better work-life balance, and flexibility in their new roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;recruitment-challenge-finding-qualified-it-talent&quot;&gt;Recruitment challenge: finding qualified IT talent&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are all aware that the recruitment challenge is not specific to the industry but across industries. Knowing there are opportunities, IT job seekers are picky when choosing their first or next job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2022, according to the Department of Labor’s latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, there were 11.3 million job openings, 6.5 million hires, and 6.1 million separations in America. This adds a whole new level of challenges and amplifies the complexity of finding the right IT talent. Contrary to such huge demand, the stagnant market of IT talents cannot meet the business requirements, either in quantity or quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although challenging, finding and hiring qualified IT talent for the proper role is not impossible. Businesses have successfully executed their recruitment campaign by hiring a team of dedicated recruiters experienced in navigating the nuances of IT recruitment. The question companies face; Do we employ an onshore recruitment team or outsource to experienced teams like RectruitTalent? The answer may seem to be simple, but it is not. It has many other underlying questions. Finding the right partner with an experienced team and the ability to scale to meet your growing needs quickly is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-does-outsourcing-recruitment-help&quot;&gt;How does outsourcing recruitment help?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing recruitment can significantly free up your time to focus on what you do best, “grow your business.” It provides a skilled team of professional recruiters dedicated to your business at a fraction of the cost providing quality resources to deliver upon your recruitment needs. It can also help you navigate the post-pandemic job market by providing access to specialized talent acquisition resources. Recruitment Outsourcing agencies can quickly adjust their recruitment processes to meet current business needs. Additionally, it can help you build a robust talent pipeline and select candidates with the right experience and attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;how-does-outsourced-recruitment-work-for-it&quot;&gt;How does outsourced recruitment work for IT?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways companies use to identify, evaluate and hire a candidate, but the two most common methods of finding qualified IT professionals are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;1-use-of-technology&quot;&gt;1. Use of technology&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many technological advances have helped recruitment services providers evolve to meet the growing demand for qualified resources. These services use various tools, including online databases, job search engines, social media platforms, etc. to help identify talented candidates. These technologies enable recruiters to identify and assess the candidates based on specific selection criteria and then downselect them with the manual evaluation of credentials and experiences. They also use technology to help you screen and interview candidates and finalize the candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-use-networks-and-relationships&quot;&gt;2. Use networks and relationships&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to use networks and relationships to find qualified candidates. These services rely on their relationship with other companies and organizations in the IT field to identify talented candidates.
How to select an outsourcing partner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We understand recruitment is not an easy task. It is marketing to the people you want to hire to be on your team and represent your brand. Selecting a partner to take upon this critical task of representing your brand needs an approach that protects your brand and delivers expected results. Not an easy task. The first thing you want to see in your recruitment service partner is a team of highly experienced professional recruiters with excellent interpersonal skills and the ability to communicate across cultures and geographies. Secondly, they should have processes in place to identify, assess, evaluate, negotiate, hire, and onboard IT professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;1-a-dedicated-team&quot;&gt;1. A Dedicated Team&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RecruitTalent has a dedicated team of professional recruiters focused on serving our customers and delivering a rewarding experience to candidates seeking a job. We have established processes and protocols for engaging the candidates and providing feedback to the customers throughout the recruitment process. Our highly qualified and skilled recruiters always strive to stay a step ahead. They are assigned to you and work as your extended team to accommodate your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-technology-and-data&quot;&gt;2. Technology and Data&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RecruitTalent helps IT employers spend less time sorting resumes and more time evaluating the qualified candidates to select the best candidate for their open positions. We use advanced technology and data sets to simplify resume search and narrow down the talent pool of qualified candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;3-extensive-database&quot;&gt;3. Extensive Database&lt;/h5&gt;

The shrinking talent pool and the competition to attract them with good salaries and great benefits make it harder to recruit and find talent for IT and cybersecurity roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported in 2018; that there will be 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs globally by 2021, up from one million positions in 2014, as predicted by Cybersecurity Ventures. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology program CyberSeek a project supported by the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE); the US alone has 597,767 open cybersecurity positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These challenges increase recruitment costs and require dedicated teams with expertise and investments in several tools and technologies to search and recruit, resulting in companies looking beyond traditional recruitment methods and seeking specialized partners to support their recruitment needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog introduces the concept of Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) and how it can transform your hiring process and provide a customized and scalable recruitment solution that delivers results and reduces cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-is-recruitment-process-outsourcing&quot;&gt;What is Recruitment Process Outsourcing?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruitment Process Outsourcing is a way to find and hire the right employees for your business by outsourcing all or some of your hiring activities to a trusted partner. Professional RPO companies provide you with an expert team that assists you with your entire recruitment process, from customer analysis to sourcing candidates and screening them. This enables you to focus on what you do best, “Growing your Business,” while an RPO supports your growth needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;the-benefits-of-rpo&quot;&gt;The Benefits of RPO&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeking out RPO is ideal for companies that need flexibility and greater control in their recruitment process. There are various benefits to outsourcing your recruitment rather than utilizing an in-house Human Resources representative. Here are seven benefits of RPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;1scalability-and-flexibility&quot;&gt;1.Scalability and Flexibility&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RPO can significantly enhance your ability to scale with the changing needs of your business and the flexibility of your business. RPO can evaluate your unique requirements and trend to anticipate your organization’s hiring needs to have the right number of skilled employees available to hire when the need arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;2-gain-access-to-specific-talent-pools&quot;&gt;2. Gain Access to Specific Talent Pools&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RPO service providers maintain an extensive database of hard-to-find personnel for various categories. This will allow your organization to easily find the most sought-after professionals from diverse backgrounds and domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;3-save-time-and-money&quot;&gt;3. Save Time and Money&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest benefits of an RPO solution is that it can help save your valuable time and money. Outsourcing the recruitment process to a qualified provider can free up your time to focus on more important tasks, such as running your business, resulting in a more efficient operation and reducing costs for your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;4-avoid-violating-laws&quot;&gt;4. Avoid Violating Laws&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employers must be familiar with the local recruitment laws and regulations. As employment rules are constantly changing, this can pose a significant challenge for human resource departments. A professional talent sourcing services provider can ease this burden by properly structuring your organizations’ recruitment process to avoid legal challenges. Since most RPOs are usually well-informed about domestic and international labor laws, it ensures your recruitment process is compliant with applicable local laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;5-quality-candidates-for-your-organization&quot;&gt;5. Quality Candidates for Your Organization&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ideal candidate needs to have much more than a simple combination of education and experience. The right personality and accomplishments matter as much, if not more. A comprehensive RPO solution can dig into those qualities while still looking for candidates with the requisite experience and education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;6-trend-analysis-to-help-shape-your-future&quot;&gt;6. Trend Analysis to Help Shape Your Future&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RPO firms use their extensive talent databases to analyze trends and predict future needs for their clients’ companies. This information allows them to advise how best to manage employee requirements, anticipate potential shortages, and make sure the right people are available when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;7-increase-your-options-and-be-consistent&quot;&gt;7. Increase your Options and be Consistent&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RPO services can help improve your search for candidates by providing a wider range of options than you could seldom find on your own. Finally, an RPO can help ensure that your hiring process is consistent and dependable, which will give you confidence in the quality of candidates you select.
Choose the Right RPO Partner&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these advantages, it is not hard to see why businesses are starting to rely on Recruitment Process Outsourcing. RecruitTalent, an experienced RPO can handle your recruitment challenges and help you achieve your recruitment objectives and find qualified candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RecruitTalent provides an RPO solution that delivers high-quality candidates and quantifiable results while reducing your recruiting costs and ensuring regulatory compliance at every stage of the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
