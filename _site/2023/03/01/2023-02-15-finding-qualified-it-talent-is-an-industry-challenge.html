<p>Let’s accept it. We face a global IT talent shortage. There are more than 11 million job openings in America today, with a greater demand for cloud computing, big data, and information security. Additionally, employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for all occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<p>The shrinking IT talent pool and an ever-increasing demand make the IT landscape highly competitive. It also makes it more challenging to find qualified talent critical for business growth. But that doesn’t mean we stop looking for talent. We have to innovate and find partners that can help find the right talent for our business’s continued growth.</p>

<p>According to a report from Pew Research Center, the most prominent reasons Americans quit their jobs last year were low pay, lack of career advancement, and disrespect. The report also found people who left for a new job received better compensation, more advancement opportunities, better work-life balance, and flexibility in their new roles.</p>
<h5 id="recruitment-challenge-finding-qualified-it-talent">Recruitment challenge: finding qualified IT talent</h5>

<p>We are all aware that the recruitment challenge is not specific to the industry but across industries. Knowing there are opportunities, IT job seekers are picky when choosing their first or next job.</p>

<p>In January 2022, according to the Department of Labor’s latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, there were 11.3 million job openings, 6.5 million hires, and 6.1 million separations in America. This adds a whole new level of challenges and amplifies the complexity of finding the right IT talent. Contrary to such huge demand, the stagnant market of IT talents cannot meet the business requirements, either in quantity or quality.</p>

<p>Although challenging, finding and hiring qualified IT talent for the proper role is not impossible. Businesses have successfully executed their recruitment campaign by hiring a team of dedicated recruiters experienced in navigating the nuances of IT recruitment. The question companies face; Do we employ an onshore recruitment team or outsource to experienced teams like RectruitTalent? The answer may seem to be simple, but it is not. It has many other underlying questions. Finding the right partner with an experienced team and the ability to scale to meet your growing needs quickly is critical.</p>
