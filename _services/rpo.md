  **RecruitTalent** provides efficient and cost-effective workforce solutions in today’s marketplace. In its RPO offering, RecruitTalent assumes management of the client’s recruiting functions for contingent labor and/or direct hires.

  **RecruitTalent’s** RPO provides quantifiable benefits through improved efficiencies, lower overhead, reduced payroll, and benefit expenses, by dedicating a recruiter to find qualified candidates while you can focus on other business requirements and grow revenue through creating robust and efficient business channels. We deliver quality results and financial savings using our internal Applicant Tracking System (ATS) and recruitment tools such as Dice, Monster, Clearance Jobs, CareerBuilder, Indeed, etc.

  The RPO empowers the client’s organization to outsource non-core business processes and reorient its focus on more important, strategic programs that create  profitable growth and sustain business success.
  Benefits of RPO:

  Clients accrue multiple benefits from RecruitTalent’s RPO program, including but not limited to:
- High levels of fill rate by dedicating a seasoned recruiter to find qualified candidates while you can focus on building effective business requirements and   pipelines.
- Not spending money on ATS and recruitment tools such as Dice, Monster, Clearance Jobs, CareerBuilder, Indeed, etc.
- Cost-effective model to enhance and fill staffing Business Opportunities.
